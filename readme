run these commands to start the application

docker-compose up -d
npm run insatll

to stop 
docker-compose down

run this command to test
npm test

I have purposely not ignored the .env file in .gitignore - 
as this is not production and just for testing

the documentation is in 'openapis.description.json'

the postman collection for testing is in postman\UserScheduleTests.postman_collection.json
