run these commands to start the application
- docker-compose up -d
please wait until the database instance is up before running 'npm run start'
- npm run start

the required tables are created when starting the app

to stop 
- docker-compose down

run this command to test - after docker compose and the database instance is up and running
- npm test

I have purposely not ignored the .env file in .gitignore - 
as this is not production and just for testing

the documentation is in 'openapis.description.json'

the postman collection for testing is in postman\UserScheduleTests.postman_collection.json
